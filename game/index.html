    <h2>Description</h2>

    <blockquote>
        <em>Dig Dug</em> is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth. Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called <strong>Pooka</strong> and <strong>Fygar</strong>, who will continually chase you around. 
        <br>
        The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. [...]

    <p>This definitely goes under the heading of "Games That Were Made While a Programmer Was on Drugs," or at least had a good imagination. And maybe they were into horror movies too.
