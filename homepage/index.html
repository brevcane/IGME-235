                    Hi, as i'm sure you already know by the giant header at the top of the page, my name 
                    is Brevin Horton. Some of my hobbies include watching and playing sports, video games, 
                    and drawing. I am a NMID major here at RIT, and my goal for this course is to be able to 
                    create projects worthy of putting onto my resume, I also am really interested in learning  
                    more about web design throughout the semester. As far as when I graduate goes, i'm not 
                    100% sure on what I want to do yet, I was in the COMPEX program all year in 2022-2023, 
                    so I feel like i'm still getting my feet wet when it comes to learning about my major,
                    but I'm excited to learn more this year and hopefully that can help me create a goal to strive for.
                </p>
